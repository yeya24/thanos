We are bunch of people from different companies with various interests and skills.
We are from different parts of Europe: Germany, Lithuania, Poland and UK. 
We have something in common though: We all share the love for OpenSource, Golang, Prometheus, :coffee: and Observability topics.

As either Software Developers or SRE (or both!) we've chosen to maintain (mostly in our free time) Thanos, the de facto way to scale awesome [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) project.

Feel free to contact us (preferably on Slack) anytime for feedback, questions or :beers:/:coffee:/:tea:.

Especially feedback, please share if you have ideas what we can do better! 

## Storage plugins maintainers

Maintainers of bucket storage clients are available [here](/docs/storage.md#implementations)

## How to be maintainer?

Any [contributor](/CONTRIBUTING.md) that shows effort and willingness in maintaining Thanos repository can join maintainer team.

Open Source is all about the trust, which is the key factor in decision to add write permissions.

In time we plan to set up maintainers team that will be organization independent. Reach us if you have any questions or want to join
maintainer team.
